# Hi there! üëã 
I'm Kevin Mudenge. 

A Front End Web Developer | A Mobile Developer from Kenya.

## About Me
### I, Heart: Embracing Individuality in a World of Many

What do you believe in? What drives you?

I recently completed my fourth year studies in Software Engineering at Multimedia University, Kenya. I have a great passion for learning languages, frameworks, and staying updated with emerging technologies. In addition to that, I enjoy designing websites, mobile apps, and bringing them to life as envisioned, as warranted. This principle guides my approach to software development, focusing on user-centered design and ensuring that each project reflects the unique needs and experiences of its users.

For me, "heart" represents a deep commitment to solving the real world. Designing <b>websites and mobile apps</b> is not just a profession for me; it's a passion and I particularly enjoy working on solutions.

- üåç Available for new opportunities
- üíº Looking for: Front-end developer and/or Mobile developer roles with real-world project applications.
