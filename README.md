### I, Heart. : Embracing Individuality in a World of Many

What do you believe in? What drives you?

I have a deep passion on the impact of technology on the world, especially through web development and its unique intricacies. I also enjoy design, art and related works. Professionally I build and also partially design websites (primarilly focusing on user-centered design and user journeys) looking to reflect the unique needs and experiences of its users: coding to solve a problem.

Heart. represents a deep commitment to solving the real world.
